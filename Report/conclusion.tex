All in all, this lab was fairly simple and straightforward to implement.
The processor correctly handles all six instructions without any errors or avoidable warnings, and the manipulated memory shows outputs as expected.
Several of the modules used in the processor had already been written in previous assignments and only needed to be slightly tweaked in order to work for this lab.
The pieces that were not built were easily delegated amongst the team as the entire structure for the processor was given before hand.
By starting on the smaller modules first, piecing together the larger modules became much easier.
This is the same for testing, as confirming that the lower level modules worked first made it a lot less difficult to identify bugs throughout the project.
The team spent a lot of time trying to fix the tri-state warnings, and was actually successful in doing so.
However, the way in which the solution was implemented made \emph{ModelSim} throw different errors that the team was never able solve.
So in the end, the tri-state warnings were ignored.
